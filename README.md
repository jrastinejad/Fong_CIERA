# Fong CIERA

GitHub repository for Fong group at CIERA.

Some examples of common Git commands:

git clone https://github.com/KerryPaterson/Fong_CIERA.git #this will clone the folder on your computer (if you have your own fork, you will replace my user name with yours)

git add file #where file is the name of a file in the git folder you have changed or added (you can add multiple files or use * to add everything)

git commit -m 'message' #commit the files you have added with git add ('message' is what will show up on GitHub)

git push origin master #push the commit from your computer to GitHub (I think this assumes you have your own fork - you would then create a pull request on GitHub to merge the changes you have made on your branch to the master fork i.e. mine but we can test it)

git status #shows changes in the folder

git diff #show the differences between the current files and what is on the remote

git branch #shows the branch you are working in in the case you have multiple branches

git checkout branch #where branch is the branch name if you want to change to a different branch

git pull #pull changes from GitHub to your computer
